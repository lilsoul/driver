# How to build locally

## Step 1: Install Tools

```
winget install --id Microsoft.Powershell --source winget
winget install --id Git.Git --source winget
```

For using WDK NuGet feed based build (experimental) additionally:
```
winget install --id Microsoft.NuGet --source winget
```

## Step 2: Clone Windows Driver Samples and checkout relevant branch

```
cd path\to\your\repos
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples.git
cd Windows-driver-samples
```

If you are planning to use in-market WDK, then you would typically want to use the 'main' branch:
```
git checkout main
```

If you are planning to use a WDK Preview or WDK EEAP release, then you would typically want to use the 'develop' branch:
```
git checkout develop
```

## Step 3: Create a "driver build environment"

To build the Windows Driver Samples you need a "driver build environment".  In essence an environment that consist of following prerequisites:
* Visual Studio Build Tools including tools such as for example cl.exe and link.exe .
* The Windows Software Development Kit.
* The Windows Driver Kit.

### Option A: Use the Windows Driver Kit
* Here you will install each of above prerequisites one at a time.
* See [install Visual Studio and the Windows Driver Kit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk#download-and-install-the-windows-11-version-22h2-wdk) for instructions. 
* Launch a "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022".

### Option B: Use an Enterprise WDK
* You can also simply use the Enterprise WDK (EWDK), a standalone, self-contained command-line environment for building drivers that contains all prerequisites in one combined ISO.
* Download the Windows 11, version 22H2 EWDK ISO image from the [official site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/windows/hardware/enterprise-wdk-license-2022)
* Mount ISO image
* Open a terminal
* `.\LaunchBuildEnv`

### Option C: Use WDK NuGet Packages from EEAP Preview Zip (experimental)
* This is an 'experimental' option.
* This option requires you have access to the WDK NuGet packages (so far only available to EEAP Partners).
* See [install Visual Studio and the Windows Driver Kit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk#download-and-install-the-windows-11-version-22h2-wdk) for instructions on how to install Visual Studio, but do not install the WDK or download the EWDK.
* Install the WDK.vsix (that you have access to as part of EEAP program).
* Launch a "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022".
* Unzip the WDK NuGet zip (that you have access to as part of EEAP program) to the root of your git enlistment in a folder that must be named .\packages. 
* When this is done you should have a .\packages folder that looks exactly as follows:

```
>cd path\to\your\repos\Windows-driver-samples
>dir /b packages
Microsoft.Windows.SDK.CPP.10.0.26052.1000-preview.ge-release
Microsoft.Windows.SDK.CPP.x64.10.0.26052.1000-preview.ge-release
Microsoft.Windows.WDK.x64.10.0.26052.1000-preview.ge-release
```
TODO: Make sure this actually matches our EEAP build out of GE_RELEASE.

TODO: Make sure above is "officially supported by DevDiv".


### Option D: Use WDK NuGet Packages from "experimental package feed"
* This is an 'experimental' option.
* This option requires you have access to "experimental package feed" MSFTNuget.  TODO:Explain what this is.
* See [install Visual Studio and the Windows Driver Kit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk#download-and-install-the-windows-11-version-22h2-wdk) for instructions on how to install Visual Studio, but do not install the WDK or download the EWDK.
* Install the WDK.vsix from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DriverDeveloperKits-WDK.WDKVsix) .
* Launch a "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022".
* Add MSFTNuget feed and restore WDK packages from feed :

```
>cd path\to\your\repos\Windows-driver-samples
>nuget sources Add -Name MSFTNuget -Source https://microsoft.pkgs.visualstudio.com/_packaging/MSFTNuget/nuget/v3/index.json
>nuget restore -PackagesDirectory .\packages
```

* When this is done you should have a .\packages folder that looks exactly as follows:
```
>cd path\to\your\repos\Windows-driver-samples
>dir /b packages
Microsoft.Windows.SDK.CPP.10.0.26052.1000-preview.ge-release
Microsoft.Windows.SDK.CPP.x64.10.0.26052.1000-preview.ge-release
Microsoft.Windows.WDK.x64.10.0.26052.1000-preview.ge-release
```


## Step 4: Check all samples builds with expected results for all flavors

```
pwsh
.\Build-AllSamples
```
Above builds all samples for all configurations and platforms.  

You can refine what exact samples to build, what configurations, and platforms to build.  build Here are a few examples:
```
# Get Help:
Get-Help .\Build-AllSamples

# Build all solutions for all flavors with builds running in parallel:
.\Build-AllSamples

# Build with Verbose output (print start and finish of each sample):
.\Build-AllSamples -Verbose

# Build without massive parallism (slow, but good debugging):
.\Build-AllSamples -ThrottleLimit 1

# Build the solutions in the tools folder for all flavors:
.\Build-AllSamples -Samples '^tools.' -Configurations 'Debug','Release' -Platforms 'x64','arm64'

# Build the solutions in the tools folder for only 'Debug|x64':
.\Build-AllSamples -Samples '^tools.' -Configurations 'Debug' -Platforms 'x64'
```

Expected output:
```
